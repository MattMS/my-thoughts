<p>I am not a lawyer, so I have no idea if the following disclaimer is
adequate, but I hope it explains my intentions.</p>
<p>If nothing else, please know that I intend no offence with the content
presented here.</p>
<p>My hope is that people will open issues on this repository to correct me
or provide alternate views.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>These thoughts are entirely my own!</p>
<p>They do not reflect those of any of my past, present or future employers
and, to the best of my ability, I try to avoid any of my contradictory
personal opinions influencing any of my professional work.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, my thoughts will change over time, and I intend that
to be reflected here.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-">What is this?</h2>
<p>As everyone does, I think about a lot of things.</p>
<p>The purpose of this site is to display my thoughts and hopefully their
progression towards a more accurate understanding of matters.</p>
