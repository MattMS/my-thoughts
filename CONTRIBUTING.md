## Searching for knowledge and opinions

My hope is that people open issues to discuss other points of view or let me know if something I have written is incorrect.


## Edits

Since these are my personal thoughts, it would not make sense for others to add new ones or change existing ones.

But I will happily accept fixes to spelling or other things that do not change the message I am trying to communicate.


## Building this site

This site is built using a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task, so you will need it installed globally.

	npm install --global gulp-cli

Once you have checked out this repo, you should run the following commands within it:

	npm install
	gulp

This will create `index.html` files from each `README.md` in all the subfolders.
