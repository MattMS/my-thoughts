## Counter-arguments

My hope is that people open issues to discuss other points of view or
let me know if something I have written is incorrect.


## Edits

Since these are my personal thoughts, it would not make sense for others
to add new ones or change existing ones.

But I will happily accept fixes to spelling or other things that do not
change the message I am trying to communicate.
