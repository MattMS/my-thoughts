# Thoughts

As everyone does, I think about a lot of things.

This site hopefully shows the progression of my thoughts towards a
better understanding of the world.

Please make sure you [read this in the correct context](/on/context/)
so my writing is not misinterpreted.

Thank you for your interest!
