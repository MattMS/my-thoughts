# Thoughts of MattMS

I am not a lawyer, so I have no idea if the following disclaimer is
adequate, but I hope it explains my intentions.

If nothing else, please know that I intend no offence with the content
presented here.

My hope is that people will open issues on this repository to correct me
or provide alternate views.


## Disclaimer

These thoughts are entirely my own!

They do not reflect those of any of my past, present or future employers
and, to the best of my ability, I try to avoid any of my contradictory
personal opinions influencing any of my professional work.

In all likelihood, my thoughts will change over time, and I intend that
to be reflected here.


## What is this?

As everyone does, I think about a lot of things.

The purpose of this site is to display my thoughts and hopefully their
progression towards a more accurate understanding of matters.
