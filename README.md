# Thoughts

As everyone does, I think about a lot of things.

You could [consider this like an ever-evolving blog][why_not_a_blog] that hopefully shows my progression of thoughts towards a better understanding of the world.

Please make sure you [read this in the correct context][context] so my writing is not misinterpreted.
Also [check the status of each page][status] to see if it is worth reading at this point in time.
