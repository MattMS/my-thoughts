# Thoughts

As everyone does, I think about a lot of things.

You could
[consider this like an ever-evolving blog](./on/why_not_a_blog/)
that hopefully shows the progression of my thoughts towards a better
understanding of the world.

Please make sure you [read this in the correct context](./on/context/)
so my writing is not misinterpreted.

Thank you for your interest!
