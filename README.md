# My thoughts

Consider this like an ever-evolving blog.


## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MattMS/my-thoughts.git
cd my-thoughts
npm install
gulp
python3 -m http.server 1337
```

`gulp` will compile all Jade files to HTML in-place.
Then you can simply run a static server from the folder.
