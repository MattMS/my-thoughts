# Flexible work

"Flexible" seems appropriate because it fits the nature of development:
responding to changing goals.

Some (short) reading for context:

- [Agile manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)

- [Async manifesto](http://asyncmanifesto.org/)

Having used aspects of both for professional and personal projects, I
thought I would share my experiences.


## Asynchronous, permanent communication

I really like the issues with comments approach of
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and others.
It is a permanent place to find why decisions were made and something to
show others when they have questions.

Comments and email allow people to collaborate while in different time
zones.
They also allow people to refresh their memory by simply scrolling up.

I dislike phone calls.
When receiving them, I am usually thrown off guard and have trouble
tracking down information.

Chatting in person does have the advantage of exposing body language.
I say "chatting" on purpose, because "meeting" has a formal nature that
I find can put people on guard.
Although without someone taking notes, much will probably be missed.


## Evolving documentation

Every project should have a README that explains how to get started and
where to find further documentation.

If this project is public, then it should include a short summary to
sell why others may be interested.
Ideally with facts and examples, rather than "better/faster than X".

A great test for the documentation is when another developer has to get
up to speed with the project.
The questions they need answered can guide documentation updates.
