<p>&quot;Flexible&quot; seems appropriate because it fits the nature of development:
responding to changing goals.</p>
<p>Some (short) reading for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://asyncmanifesto.org/">Async manifesto</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having used aspects of both for professional and personal projects, I
thought I would share my experiences.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-permanent-communication">Asynchronous, permanent communication</h2>
<p>I really like the issues with comments approach of
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and others.
It is a permanent place to find why decisions were made and something to
show others when they have questions.</p>
<p>Comments and email allow people to collaborate while in different time
zones.
They also allow people to refresh their memory by simply scrolling up.</p>
<p>I dislike phone calls.
When receiving them, I am usually thrown off guard and have trouble
tracking down information.</p>
<p>Chatting in person does have the advantage of exposing body language.
I say &quot;chatting&quot; on purpose, because &quot;meeting&quot; has a formal nature that
I find can put people on guard.
Although without someone taking notes, much will probably be missed.</p>
<h2 id="evolving-documentation">Evolving documentation</h2>
<p>Every project should have a README that explains how to get started and
where to find further documentation.</p>
<p>If this project is public, then it should include a short summary to
sell why others may be interested.
Ideally with facts and examples, rather than &quot;better/faster than X&quot;.</p>
<p>A great test for the documentation is when another developer has to get
up to speed with the project.
The questions they need answered can guide documentation updates.</p>
