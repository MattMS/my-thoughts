<p>Status: <a href="../status/">readable</a>.</p>
<p>Growing up, my family did not force any particular belief system on me.
Opinions were shared, but it was more about keeping an open mind rather
than directing thoughts.</p>
<p>My friends and family have different religious and spiritual beliefs,
and gatherings exposed me to their practices and views.</p>
<p>Until my mid-20s, I was quite skeptical of it all and probably would
have called myself an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a>.
But now I am becoming more open to the other aspects of religion, beyond
their belief systems.</p>
<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>At school, I recall visiting a church and a couple of times when a
chaplain spoke to our class.
I gathered that the majority of students had no interest in it because
these events were usually mocked afterwards.</p>
<p>I did quite well at school and started to understand the world through
science and logic, which further defined my skepticism in religion.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to make it clear that I do not think this was wrong.
I think people should be respectful of beliefs, but I do not think this
should be at the expense of explaining the world through the scientific
process.</p>
<p>I think that providing everyone a better understanding of science can
only improve our lives in this world.
But as with anything, this also requires knowing who commissioned the
studies and what their interests are.</p>
<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>
<p>Although the majority of people I know do not seem interested in
religion, I do have religious friends.
Over the years I have heard their views on different topics, which I
always find interesting.</p>
<p>I think my parents approach of not forcing, but still exposing us to
different groups, along with hearing friends views has made me a lot
more open to viewing the world in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Given my current job, which is entirely based around science, it seems
quite ironic that I am becoming increasingly interested in learning
about different beliefs.
But this is more likely related to my own curiousity rather than my
current environment.</p>
<p>This curiousity extends into many different philosophical questions too.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>I will continue expanding this page as I learn more so I do not think
it will ever be finished.</p>
<p>Any input would be greatly appreciated and will hopefully provide
additions to this page!</p>
