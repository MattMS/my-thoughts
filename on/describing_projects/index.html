<p>Some suggestions on ways to gather the information from clients about
projects.</p>
<h2 id="question-feature-requests">Question feature requests</h2>
<p>Clients may request features because they are unaware of alternatives.</p>
<p>Requests may also be based on existing work-flows that will change with
the new product, making the feature unnecessary.</p>
<p>Discovering why a client wants a feature will help decide if and how it
should be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="define-user-types">Define user types</h2>
<p>Before deciding on features, it is helpful to know the types of users
that want them.</p>
<p>Here are some of the possible user types for a messaging application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All users want to send and receive messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Group managers want to add and remove users from their group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Account managers want to create new accounts and reset passwords.</p>
</li>
<li><p>System managers want to know the usage and growth rate of storage so
they know when they need to increase the capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list specifies the types of users and their main goals.</p>
<h2 id="use-stories-to-describe-features">Use stories to describe features</h2>
<p>Features of an application can be described as stories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a group manager,
I want to add a user to my group,
so that they can receive group messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usual structure is &quot;As a ? I want ? so that ?&quot;.
This specifies the type of user, the feature they want and the reason
for it.</p>
<p>The &quot;so that&quot; part is used to justify why a person wants a feature.
This may expose issues with the feature that lead to a better solution.</p>
<h2 id="decide-importance-of-features">Decide importance of features</h2>
<p>Features should be given an importance in relation to the project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Must have&quot; means the project fails without them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Should have&quot; will not stop the project being delivered, but will be
given preference if there is time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Nice to have&quot; are unlikely to be done, but still worth noting for a
future release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="define-test-criteria-for-features">Define test criteria for features</h2>
<p>Every feature requires test criteria to describe when it is complete.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Developers use this to know what work must be done.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testers use it to confirm the feature has been implemented properly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the previous story, the test may be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given I am a group manager
and I am on a user profile page,
when I click the &quot;add user to group&quot; button,
then the user becomes part of my group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main structure of the test is &quot;given ? when ? then ?&quot;.
Each of those sections can include multiple states, actions and results
that are joined with &quot;and ?&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="regular-feedback">Regular feedback</h2>
<p>You should try to have something to test at regular intervals, such as
every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Feedback from client testing may result in scope changes.
This is not a bad thing, as long as the client is made aware of the
consequences of the choices they are requesting.</p>
