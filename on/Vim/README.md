# Vim

Status: [started](../status/).

My favourite text editor.


## My path to Vim

Vim is not fun to start with.
You are not likely to fall in love with it on the first day or week.
Vim is all about muscle memory, and that takes time.

My first few attempts saw me giving up within a few hours.

I read the tutorial and used it on server files, but it was still slower
than copying the files to my local machine so I could edit in a familiar
way.


### Sublime Text

I knew about Sublime Text but never really checked it out until it was
mentioned at work.

After downloading it and having a quick play, I could see why others
liked it so much.
It had a bunch of cool and intuitive features that sped up my coding
considerably.

Then I found Vim-mode, with modal editing and similar navigation.
It was strange to start with, but I (reasonably) quickly became used to
it.

My only issue with Sublime Text was that it was slow on my netbook.


### Back to Vim

With my navigation patterns built up, I was able to use Vim more
effectively.

I could also use Vim on every (keyboard-driven) computer - netbook,
desktop, server.


## Combining simple actions

Probably the greatest strength of Vim is that actions are built from
combinations of simpler actions.

While in normal mode, many actions are followed with a movement.
So delete the next 2 words would be `d2e` (`e` for end of word).
Copy (yank) the next 3 words would be `y3e`.
