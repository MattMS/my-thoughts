# Making myself redundant

Status: [readable](../status/).

One of my main goals is to make myself redundant.

This does not mean I want to leave my work; it simply means I know that
someone can continue the work I have started.


## Saving my work

If someone is unable to understand something I have written, then they
are more likely to rewrite it.

This means my previous work was wasted and their time is wasted
replacing it.

A worse case is that they replace it with a way that I have already
found not to work, but failed to communicate it.


### Documentation

Documentation needs a clear entry point for someone to start learning a
system.
They should then be directed to the solution as quickly as possible.
I lose focus if I have to read through a bunch of unrelated information
when I have a specific question to be answered.

One way to do this is to have a README in each folder that gives a
summary of what the files contain and how they work together.


### Code comments

It is more important to know *why* something was done, rather than what
it is doing.

The other side is why something was not done, to prevent others failing
with it again.


### Code review

If someone can follow what I have done, without me instructing them,
then there is a better chance it is understandable.

They may even suggest another approach that I had not considered.


## Leave without worries

When the time comes for me to move on, I would like to know that my
replacement is not going to be cursing me for the confusing mess I have
left them.


## To my predecessors

This page is not targeted at anyone I have replaced, even if I have
replaced your work.
This was driven by my own goals for anyone that replaces me.
