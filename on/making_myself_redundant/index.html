<p>Status: <a href="../status/">started</a>.</p>
<p>One of my main goals is to make myself redundant.</p>
<p>This does not mean I want to leave my work; it simply means I know that
someone can continue any work I have started.</p>
<h2 id="saving-my-work">Saving my work</h2>
<p>If someone is unable to understand something I have written, then it is
more likely they will replace it.</p>
<p>This means my previous work was wasted and their time is wasted
replacing it.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation needs a clear entry point for someone to start learning a
system and then they should be directed to the solution as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>I lose focus if I have to read through a bunch of unrelated information
when I have a specific question to be answered.</p>
<p>As for code comments, it is more important to know <em>why</em> something was
done, rather than what it is doing.</p>
<h3 id="code-review">Code review</h3>
<p>If someone can follow what I have done, without me giving them clues,
then there is a better chance it is understandable.</p>
<p>They may even suggest another approach that I had not considered.</p>
<h2 id="leave-without-worries">Leave without worries</h2>
<p>When the time comes for me to move on, I would like to know that my
replacement is not going to be cursing me for the confusing mess I have
left them.</p>
<h2 id="to-my-predecessors">To my predecessors</h2>
<p>This page is not targeted at anyone I have replaced, even if I have
replaced your work.
This was driven by my own goals for anyone that replaces me.</p>
