<p>Status: <a href="../status/">readable</a>.</p>
<p>One of my main goals is to make myself redundant.</p>
<p>This does not mean I want to leave my work; it simply means I know that
someone can continue the work I have started.</p>
<h2 id="saving-my-work">Saving my work</h2>
<p>If someone is unable to understand something I have written, then they
are more likely to rewrite it.</p>
<p>This means my previous work was wasted and their time is wasted
replacing it.</p>
<p>A worse case is that they replace it with a way that I have already
found not to work, but failed to communicate it.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation needs a clear entry point for someone to start learning a
system.
They should then be directed to the solution as quickly as possible.
I lose focus if I have to read through a bunch of unrelated information
when I have a specific question to be answered.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to have a README in each folder that gives a
summary of what the files contain and how they work together.</p>
<h3 id="code-comments">Code comments</h3>
<p>It is more important to know <em>why</em> something was done, rather than what
it is doing.</p>
<p>The other side is why something was not done, to prevent others failing
with it again.</p>
<h3 id="code-review">Code review</h3>
<p>If someone can follow what I have done, without me instructing them,
then there is a better chance it is understandable.</p>
<p>They may even suggest another approach that I had not considered.</p>
<h2 id="leave-without-worries">Leave without worries</h2>
<p>When the time comes for me to move on, I would like to know that my
replacement is not going to be cursing me for the confusing mess I have
left them.</p>
<h2 id="to-my-predecessors">To my predecessors</h2>
<p>This page is not targeted at anyone I have replaced, even if I have
replaced your work.
This was driven by my own goals for anyone that replaces me.</p>
