# Religion

I characterise myself as
[open agnostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism).
Where the "open" qualifier describes my interest in learning more about
all religions.

The first part of this page explains how my life has shaped my approach
to beliefs.

The rest of the page gives my views on topics and shares some works that
have changed the way I look at the world.


## My life

Growing up, my family did not force any particular belief system on me.
Opinions were shared, but it was more about opening our minds rather
than directing us to something.

Friends of my family have different religious and spiritual beliefs,
some from different cultures, and gatherings exposed me to their
different practices and views.

As a child, I was quite skeptical of it all and probably would have
called myself an atheist.


### School

At school, I recall visiting a church and a couple of times when a
chaplain spoke to our class.
I gathered that the majority of students had no interest in it because
these events were usually mocked afterwards.

I did quite well at school and started to understand the world through
science and logic, which further defined my skepticism in religion.

As an aside, I want to make it clear that I do not think this was wrong.
I think people should be respectful of beliefs, but I do not think this
should be at the expense of explaining the world through the scientific
process.

I think that providing everyone a better understanding of science can
only improve our lives in this world.
But as with anything, this also requires knowing who commissioned the
studies and what their interests are.


### Friends

Although the majority of people I know do not seem interested in
religion, I do have some friends that are religious.
Over the years I have heard their views on different topics, which I
always find interesting.

I think my parents approach of not forcing, but still exposing us to
different groups, along with hearing friends views has made me a lot
more open to viewing the world in different ways.


### Work

Given my current job, which is entirely based around science, it seems
quite ironic that I am becoming increasingly interested in learning
about different beliefs.
But this is more likely related to my own curiousity rather than my
current environment.

This curiousity extends into many different philosophical questions too.


### Future

I have heard that wisdom is knowledge solidifying in the brain, but as I
grow older I hope that I am still able to keep an open mind to all the
different views this world provides.


## Extremism

I find extremist views and actions terrible, not only in themselves, but
also in how they damage the perception of those belief systems.

The majority of my direct experience with people of different religions
has been positive.
I find most to be empathetic, open to discussion and non-critical of
others that hold different beliefs.

This view has developed over the years from interactions with different
people.

It is unfortunate that many people develop opinions on the religion,
rather than the particular extremist group.


## Films

These are a few films that helped shape my views on religion.


### Life of Pi

[Life of Pi on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_%28film%29)

Pi's acceptance of different religions was inspirational and fits with
my own curiousity.


### Oh My God

[Oh My God on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_God_%282009_film%29)

Interesting to see people concisely describe different beliefs.

It was also nice that the end message was mostly "God is love".


### The Thirteenth Floor

[The Thirteenth Floor on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/)

If life can be a simulation, then something could have created it.

Watching [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) before
this may have also helped, but I did not realise this at the time.
