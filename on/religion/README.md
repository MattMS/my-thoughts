# Religion

I characterise myself as
[open agnostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism).
The "open" qualifier describes my interest in learning more about all
religions.


## Extremism

I find extremist views and actions terrible, not only in themselves, but
also in how they damage the perception of those belief systems.

The majority of my direct experience with people of different religions
has been positive.
I find most to be empathetic, open to discussion and non-critical of
others that hold different beliefs.

This view has developed over the years from interactions with different
people.

It is unfortunate that many people develop opinions on the religion,
rather than the particular extremist group.


## Films

These are a few films that shaped my views on religion.


### Life of Pi

[Life of Pi on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_%28film%29)

Pi's acceptance of different religions was inspirational and fits with
my own curiousity.


### Oh My God

[Oh My God on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_God_%282009_film%29)

Interesting to see people concisely describe different beliefs.

It was also nice that the end message was mostly "God is love".


### The Thirteenth Floor

[The Thirteenth Floor on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/)

If life can be a simulation, then there could be an intelligent creator.

Watching [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) before
this may have also helped, but I did not realise this at the time.
