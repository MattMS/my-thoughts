# Religion

Status: [started](../status/).

I characterise myself as
[open agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism).
Where the "open" qualifier describes my interest in learning more about
all religions.

You can read about [religion in my life](../religion_in_my_life/) to
learn how my views have been shaped.
I am also working on a
[list of films that changed my opinions on religion](../religious_views_from_films/).
