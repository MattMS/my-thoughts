<p>Status: <a href="../status/">started</a>.</p>
<p>I characterise myself as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism">open agnostic</a>.
Where the &quot;open&quot; qualifier describes my interest in learning more about
all religions.</p>
<p>The first part of this page explains how my life has shaped my approach
to beliefs.</p>
<p>The rest of the page gives my views on topics and shares some works that
have changed the way I look at the world.</p>
<h2 id="my-life">My life</h2>
<p>Growing up, my family did not force any particular belief system on me.
Opinions were shared, but it was more about opening our minds rather
than directing us to something.</p>
<p>Friends of my family have different religious and spiritual beliefs,
some from different cultures, and gatherings exposed me to their
different practices and views.</p>
<p>As a child, I was quite skeptical of it all and probably would have
called myself an atheist.</p>
<h3 id="school">School</h3>
<p>At school, I recall visiting a church and a couple of times when a
chaplain spoke to our class.
I gathered that the majority of students had no interest in it because
these events were usually mocked afterwards.</p>
<p>I did quite well at school and started to understand the world through
science and logic, which further defined my skepticism in religion.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to make it clear that I do not think this was wrong.
I think people should be respectful of beliefs, but I do not think this
should be at the expense of explaining the world through the scientific
process.</p>
<p>I think that providing everyone a better understanding of science can
only improve our lives in this world.
But as with anything, this also requires knowing who commissioned the
studies and what their interests are.</p>
<h3 id="friends">Friends</h3>
<p>Although the majority of people I know do not seem interested in
religion, I do have some friends that are religious.
Over the years I have heard their views on different topics, which I
always find interesting.</p>
<p>I think my parents approach of not forcing, but still exposing us to
different groups, along with hearing friends views has made me a lot
more open to viewing the world in different ways.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>Given my current job, which is entirely based around science, it seems
quite ironic that I am becoming increasingly interested in learning
about different beliefs.
But this is more likely related to my own curiousity rather than my
current environment.</p>
<p>This curiousity extends into many different philosophical questions too.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>I have heard that wisdom is knowledge solidifying in the brain, but as I
grow older I hope that I am still able to keep an open mind to all the
different views this world provides.</p>
<h2 id="extremism">Extremism</h2>
<p>I find extremist views and actions terrible, not only in themselves, but
also in how they damage the perception of those belief systems.</p>
<p>The majority of my direct experience with people of different religions
has been positive.
I find most to be empathetic, open to discussion and non-critical of
others that hold different beliefs.</p>
<p>This view has developed over the years from interactions with different
people.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that many people develop opinions on the religion,
rather than the particular extremist group.</p>
<h2 id="films">Films</h2>
<p>These are a few films that helped shape my views on religion.</p>
<h3 id="life-of-pi">Life of Pi</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_%28film%29">Life of Pi on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Pi&#39;s acceptance of different religions was inspirational and fits with
my own curiousity.</p>
<h3 id="oh-my-god">Oh My God</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_God_%282009_film%29">Oh My God on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Interesting to see people concisely describe different beliefs.</p>
<p>It was also nice that the end message was mostly &quot;God is love&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="the-thirteenth-floor">The Thirteenth Floor</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/">The Thirteenth Floor on IMDB</a></p>
<p>If life can be a simulation, then something could have created it.</p>
<p>Watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a> before
this may have also helped, but I did not realise this at the time.</p>
