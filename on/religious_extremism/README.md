# Religious extremism

Status: [started](../status/).

I find extremist views and actions terrible, not only in themselves, but
also in how they damage the perception of those belief systems.

The majority of my direct experience with people of different religions
has been positive.
I find most to be empathetic, open to discussion and non-critical of
others that hold different beliefs.

This view has developed over the years from interactions with different
people.

It is unfortunate that many people develop opinions on the religion,
rather than the particular extremist group.
