# Religious views from films

Status: [started](../status/).

These are a few films that helped shape my views on religion.


## Life of Pi

[Life of Pi on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_%28film%29)

Pi's acceptance of different religions was inspirational and fits with
my own curiousity.


## Oh My God

[Oh My God on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_God_%282009_film%29)

Interesting to see people concisely describe different beliefs.

It was also nice that the end message was mostly "God is love".


## The Thirteenth Floor

[The Thirteenth Floor on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/)

If life can be a simulation, then something could have created it.

Watching [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) before
this may have also helped, but I did not realise this at the time.
