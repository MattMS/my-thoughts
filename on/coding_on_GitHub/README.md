# Coding on GitHub

Status: [started](../status/).

This page describes how I develop and share code on GitHub.

These are my own opinions that will likely change over time.
I will try to link to articles to support my thoughts.


## README

Start with a README file, even if it is only a single sentence.

Whenever I look at a project on GitHub, if it does not have a README
then I am less likely to look through it, because it already feels
incomplete.

The main things I hope to find are:

- A quick summary of the project.

- Installation instruction or a link to detailed steps if they are
  complex.

- Requirements, even if they seem obvious.

- Examples!!!

I stopped myself from emphasising that more, but examples are the most
important thing for me.
They let me see the elegant syntax of your library and imagine how I
could use it in my own projects.
