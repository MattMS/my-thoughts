# Snake-case vs camel-case

Status: [started](../status/).

I like to use [snake-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
over [camel-case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) for all
variable and function names.

If variable names are made of multiple words, and words are usually
separated by spaces, then swapping the space for an underscore seems
better than joining them together then trying to figure out if you drop
the case on an acronym.

	XML_to_JSON > XMLToJSON
	xml_to_json > XmlToJson

I follow this same rule when hyphens are allowed, such as file names and
CSS classes.
