# Working to be redundant

One of my main goals is to make myself redundant.

This does not mean I want to leave my work; it simply means I know that
someone can continue any work I have started.


## Saving my work

If someone is unable to understand something I have written, then there
is a greater possibility that they will replace it.

This means my previous work was wasted and their time is wasted
replacing it.


### Documentation

There needs to be an entry point for someone to start reading and then
be directed to solutions as quickly as possible.

It is more important to know *why* something was done, rather than what
it is doing.


### Code review

If someone can follow and understand what I have done, without me giving
them clues, then I know it is safe.

They may even suggest another approach that I had not considered.


## Leave without worries

When the time comes for me to move on, I would like to know that my
replacement is not cursing me for the confusing mess I have left them.


## To my predecessors

This page is not targeted at anyone I have replaced, even if I have
replaced your work.
This was driven by my own goals for anyone that replaces me.
