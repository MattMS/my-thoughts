# Year-beard

Last month I finished my year-beard challenge.

This involved not cutting or trimming my beard or hair for 1 year.

I had not planned to do it, so I am not sure how long it went for
exactly, but it was approximately November 2013 to 2014.


## Beginning

I have kept short hair and been fairly clean shaven for the previous 10
years, so this was a big change for me.

During most of the time I had it, I was still surprised each time I saw
myself in mirrors.

I think this was part of the reason most of my family did not like it.
I probably seemed like a completely different person.


## Response

I had a positive response from most people that witnessed it and as I
reached the end of the challenge, I had many requests to keep it.
Even I had moments of doubt about whether to remove it.

In the end I knew that I had set out to have it for 1 year, so it was
relatively easy for me to let it go.


## Aftermath

Although my mental image of myself had not completely adjusted to having
it, once it was removed, I had the same surprise at seeing myself in
mirrors.

I am thankful that I managed to see it through and finish it off, but
part of me misses it.

When eating food, I still go to move my moustache out of the way.


## Suggestions for others

I would recommend trying it if you are interested.

Most people treat you differently (in a positive way) and can appreciate
the challenge of maintaining it.

The downside is that it will likely be a pain during most of your meals.
I would also leave considerably more hair wherever I went.

It is definitely worth trying at least once in your life.
