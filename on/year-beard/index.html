<p>On the 29th of November 2014, I finished my year-beard challenge.</p>
<p>This involved not cutting or trimming my beard or hair for 1 year.</p>
<p>I had not planned to do it, so I am not sure when it started, but I
recall telling people about it around mid-November 2013.</p>
<h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2>
<p>I have kept short hair and been fairly clean shaven for the previous 10
years, so this was a big change for me.</p>
<p>I think this was part of the reason most of my family did not like it.
I probably seemed like a completely different person.</p>
<p>During the entire time I had it, I was still surprised each time I saw
myself in mirrors.
A good surprise though, it always made me more determined to reach my
goal.</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>I had a positive response from most people and as I reached the end of
the challenge, there were quite a few requests to keep it.</p>
<p>Even I had moments of doubt about whether to remove it.
But in the end I knew that I had set out to have it for 1 year, so it
was relatively easy for me to let it go.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Although my mental image of myself had not completely adjusted to having
it, once it was removed, I had a similar surprise at seeing myself in
mirrors.</p>
<p>I am thankful that I managed to see it through and finish it off, but
part of me misses it.</p>
<p>For the first few weeks, I would still go to move my moustache out of
the way before eating food.</p>
<h2 id="my-overall-experience">My overall experience</h2>
<p>Most people treated me differently, usually in a positive way, like
appreciating the challenge of maintaining it.</p>
<p>The downside was that it was a pain during most of my meals.
I also left considerably more hair wherever I went.</p>
<p>Looking back at the whole experience, I am happy I did it.</p>
