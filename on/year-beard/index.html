<p>Last month I finished my year-beard challenge.</p>
<p>This involved not cutting or trimming my beard or hair for 1 year.</p>
<p>I had not planned to do it, so I am not sure how long it went for
exactly, but it was approximately November 2013 to 2014.</p>
<h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2>
<p>I have kept short hair and been fairly clean shaven for the previous 10
years, so this was a big change for me.</p>
<p>During most of the time I had it, I was still surprised each time I saw
myself in mirrors.</p>
<p>I think this was part of the reason most of my family did not like it.
I probably seemed like a completely different person.</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>I had a positive response from most people that witnessed it and as I
reached the end of the challenge, I had many requests to keep it.
Even I had moments of doubt about whether to remove it.</p>
<p>In the end I knew that I had set out to have it for 1 year, so it was
relatively easy for me to let it go.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Although my mental image of myself had not completely adjusted to having
it, once it was removed, I had the same surprise at seeing myself in
mirrors.</p>
<p>I am thankful that I managed to see it through and finish it off, but
part of me misses it.</p>
<p>When eating food, I still go to move my moustache out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="suggestions-for-others">Suggestions for others</h2>
<p>I would recommend trying it if you are interested.</p>
<p>Most people treat you differently (in a positive way) and can appreciate
the challenge of maintaining it.</p>
<p>The downside is that it will likely be a pain during most of your meals.
I would also leave considerably more hair wherever I went.</p>
<p>It is definitely worth trying at least once in your life.</p>
