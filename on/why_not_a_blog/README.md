# Why not a blog?

This page explains why I have chosen to format this site how it is,
rather than creating a typical blog.


## Not a blog or news site

Firstly, I dislike the term "blog".
There are still people that do not know what a blog is, and I can avoid
that confusion by simply using a different name.
I prefer "news", since it applies outside the Internet too.

But I chose not to call this a "news" site either, because that implies
that the content is specific to the time it was originally created.

The content on this site is meant to be timeless.
Every page will display my current opinion, even if you read it long
after I have published it.

This works because I intend to update pages as my views change.


## Progression of thoughts

A blog/news site can also do this, since entries are usually displayed
in reverse-chronological order.
So an entry with a newer date will show the current view, while an older
entry will show the previous view.

But what if a person is taken directly to an older page?
Some people update older posts with a link to the newer one, but this is
not always the case.

If I update existing pages then there is no chance for someone to view
outdated information and assume it is my current opinion.

But editing old pages could make it impossible for someone to view my
progression of thoughts.
My hopeful solution to this comes down to my editing style.


## Permanency of links

One goal of Internet sites should be to maintain permanent links to
information.

If someone links to a page as a reference, and then that link or the
content is changed, then the original reference is broken.

Updating the content of my existing pages could break those references
if it is not done properly.

When editing an existing page, my intention is to keep the existing
content intact (as much as possible), but then add any changes that I
have realised after.

Ideally this will mean that references will still apply, but then the
reader can also discover my newer views on a topic, without having to
visit the newer page.


## Tell me if this breaks

Although I will be trying my best to follow the plan I have outlined
above, there is always the possibility that I will break something.

If you have or discover a broken link/reference from somewhere, please
let me know so that I can fix it.

You should be able to
[find how to contact me](http://about.mattms.info) on my about me site.

Hopefully this format works, but I am always open to suggestions about
how I can improve it.
