<p>Status: <a href="../status/">readable</a>.</p>
<p>This page explains why I have chosen to format this site how it is,
rather than creating a typical blog.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-blog-news-site">Not a blog/news site</h2>
<p>Firstly, I dislike the term &quot;blog&quot;.
There are still people that do not know what a blog is, and I can avoid
that confusion by simply using a different name.
I prefer &quot;news&quot;, since it applies outside the Internet too.</p>
<p>But I chose not to call this a &quot;news&quot; site either, because that implies
that the content is specific to the time it was originally created.</p>
<p>The content on this site is meant to be timeless.
Every page will display my current opinion, even if you read it long
after I have published it.</p>
<p>This works because I intend to update pages as my views change.</p>
<h2 id="progression-of-thoughts">Progression of thoughts</h2>
<p>A blog/news site can also do this, since entries are usually displayed
in reverse-chronological order.
So an entry with a newer date will show the current view, while an older
entry will show the previous view.</p>
<p>But what if a person is taken directly to an older page?
Some people update older posts with a link to the newer one, but this is
not always the case.</p>
<p>If I update existing pages then there is no chance for someone to view
outdated information and assume it is my current opinion.</p>
<p>But editing old pages could make it impossible for someone to view my
progression of thoughts.
My hopeful solution to this comes down to my editing style.</p>
<h2 id="permanency-of-links">Permanency of links</h2>
<p>One goal of Internet sites should be to maintain permanent links to
information.</p>
<p>If someone links to a page as a reference, and then that link or the
content is changed, then the original reference is broken.</p>
<p>Updating the content of my existing pages could break those references
if it is not done properly.</p>
<p>When editing an existing page, my intention is to keep the existing
content intact (as much as possible), but then add any changes that I
have realised after.</p>
<p>Ideally this will mean that references will still apply, but then the
reader can also discover my newer views on a topic, without having to
visit the newer page.</p>
<h2 id="tell-me-if-this-breaks">Tell me if this breaks</h2>
<p>Although I will be trying my best to follow the plan I have outlined
above, there is always the possibility that I will break something.</p>
<p>If you have or discover a broken link/reference from somewhere, please
let me know so that I can fix it.</p>
<p>You should be able to
<a href="http://about.mattms.info">find how to contact me</a> on my about me site.</p>
<p>Hopefully this format works, but I am always open to suggestions about
how I can improve it.</p>
