<p>It is almost a requirement as a developer to pick a side in the tabs vs
spaces war.</p>
<p>I side with tabs.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-file-size">Smaller file size</h2>
<p>I decided to start with the obvious one, even though it is not such a
big deal with cheap and fast storage.</p>
<p>It is still a point that spaces will always have against them.</p>
<h2 id="indentation-errors">Indentation errors</h2>
<p>The more spaces you use for indentation, the greater the chance you will
accidentally add an extra space that will break things.</p>
<h2 id="one-key-indent-unindent">One key indent/unindent</h2>
<p>Add with the tab key and remove with backspace.</p>
<p>One benefit of this is it works in even the most basic editors.</p>
<h2 id="viewer-defined-indent-width">Viewer-defined indent width</h2>
<p>The unknown indent width is called a disadvantage due to losing the
certainty of a fixed width.</p>
<p>Sticking to a fixed width has other problems (URL &gt; 80 chars).</p>
<p>Letting a user pick the indent seems a nice extra to me.</p>
<h2 id="places-tabs-have-lost">Places tabs have lost</h2>
<p>Unfortunately there are some places that tabs are banned and spaces have
claimed victory.</p>
<h3 id="yaml">Yaml</h3>
<p>I choose Yaml for any structured data I can, so I have been forced to
use spaces, as tabs are invalid.</p>
<p>Initially I kept to single space indent, but with more vertical space.
But now I have moved to 2 space indent, and less vertical space.</p>
<h3 id="web-forms">Web forms</h3>
<p>Since tab jumps to the next field, I am stuck with spaces.</p>
<p>Usually the code I write in forms is very small, so I use single-space
indent.</p>
