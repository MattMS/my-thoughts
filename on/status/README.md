# Status

This page describes my classification of the completeness of pages on
this site.


## Started

You should probably ignore these pages unless you would like to help
shape my views on a subject.

They are likely just placeholders to remind me to expand on a topic
later.


## Readable

These should contain a description and conclusion on a subject.

I will likely add more details, but the general idea will probably not
change.
