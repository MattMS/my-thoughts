# Status

This describes my classification of the completeness of pages on this
site.


## Started

You should probably ignore these pages unless you would like to help
shape my views on a subject.

They are likely just placeholders to remind me to expand on a topic as
I research it more.


## Readable

Readable pages should give you a fairly accurate idea of my thoughts on
the subject.

Expansion of thoughts are more likely than changes of opinion, but I am
always hoping for new ideas or corrections.

You can read them now but it may be worthwhile checking again when it is
complete.


## Complete

Complete pages should contain all the information that I am wanting to
present on the topic.

It does not mean finished forever, as my opinion may change later, but
you should feel comfortable reading the page now.

If I get new information then the page will be updated to reflect this.
