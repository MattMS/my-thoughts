# Status

This page describes my classification of the completeness of pages on
this site.


## Started

You should probably ignore these pages unless you would like to help
shape my views on a subject.

They are likely just placeholders to remind me to expand on a topic as
I research it more.


## Readable

Readable pages should give you a fairly accurate idea of my thoughts on
the subject.

Expansion of thoughts are more likely than changes of opinion, but I am
always hoping for new ideas or corrections.


## Complete

Complete pages should contain all the information that I am wanting to
present on the topic.

I may make minor edits, like changing words, but I am unlikely to add
new sections or large blocks of text.

If I get new information or my opinion changes, then the page will be
updated to reflect this.
