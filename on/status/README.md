# Status

This page describes my classification of the completeness of pages on
this site.


## Started

You should probably ignore these pages unless you would like to help
shape my views on a subject.

They are likely just placeholders to remind me to expand on a topic as
I research it more.


## Readable

Reading these pages should give you a fairly accurate idea of my
thoughts on the subject.

Expansion of thoughts are more likely than changes of opinion, but I am
always hoping for new ideas or corrections.
