<p>This page is far from finished, but at least I can use it to get
suggestions from others.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>As a straight, white male, I cannot think of a time I have faced
discrimination, so I do not know how it feels.
But I understand that discrimination and stereotyping are bad and I hope
I have avoided hurting anyone in that way.</p>
<h2 id="divisive-presentation">Divisive presentation</h2>
<p>I was originally prompted to think more about this after reading of a
conference speaker that used a slide with gender stereotypes when
describing his girlfriend.</p>
<p>My initial thought (similar to others I read) was that the slide was
only referring to his girlfriend and not all women.
The only person that should have been insulted was his girlfriend,
unless he had shown her first and she was ok with it.</p>
<p>The bigger response was that the slide was sexist, to the extent that
even his employer apologised for it.</p>
<p>In trying to figure out how I could avoid a similar mistake, it made me
think about how to identify it.</p>
<h2 id="my-existing-approach">My existing approach</h2>
<p>Up until now, my way of avoiding offence has been based on thinking if
what I am saying is negatively highlighting a difference between myself
and the listener.</p>
<p>The issue faced by the speaker was that his negative comments were
abstracted from describing his girlfriend to describing all women.</p>
<p>The easy answer would be to forbid people from highlighting any
differences.
But this would likely be seen as political correctness gone too far.</p>
<h2 id="racism">Racism</h2>
<p>I enjoy the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boondocks_(TV_series)">The Boondocks</a> and laugh at the over-the-top
racism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ruckus">Uncle Ruckus</a>.
But the absurdity of what he gets away with is disappointing if it is
taken as a reflection of parts of our society.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I feel uncomfortable when people make honest statements
based on preconceptions.
It is even worse when it starts to impact decisions they make or ideas
they have.</p>
<h2 id="going-forward">Going forward</h2>
<p>At this stage I am not sure how to resolve my concerns.</p>
<p>It seems misinterpretation happens easily and there is no clear approach
on how to avoid it.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can expand this into something more useful after further
discussion with others.</p>
