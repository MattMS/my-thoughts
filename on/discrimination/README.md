# Discrimination

As a straight, white male, I cannot think of a time I have faced
discrimination, so I do not know how it feels.
But I can recognise the problems caused by discrimination and
stereotyping.


## Divisive presentation

I was originally prompted to think more about this after reading of a
conference speaker that used a slide with gender stereotypes when
describing his girlfriend.

My initial thought (similar to others I read) was that the slide was
only referring to his girlfriend and not all women.
The only person that should have been insulted was his girlfriend,
unless he had shown her first and she was ok with it.

The bigger response was that the slide was sexist, to the extent that
even his employer apologised for it.

In trying to figure out how I could avoid a similar mistake, it made me
think about how to identify it.


## My existing approach

Up until now, my way of avoiding offence has been based on thinking if
what I am saying is negatively highlighting a difference between myself
and the listener.

The issue faced by the speaker was that his negative comments were
abstracted from describing his girlfriend to describing all women.

The easy answer would be to forbid people from highlighting any
differences.
But this would likely be seen as political correctness gone too far.


## Going forward

At this stage I am not sure how to resolve my concerns.

It seems misinterpretation happens easily and there is no clear approach
on how to avoid it.

Hopefully I can expand this into something more useful after further
discussion with others.
