# Nanna

Status: [started](../status/).

My grandmother passed away on 2014-11-17, at the age of 94.

When [Mum](../Mum/) told me that Nanna had died, it was a very surreal
feeling.
The only thought I had, that blocked all others, was to get
[Doug](../Doug/ "my younger brother") and travel to see Mum at the
nursing home.

Nanna was the only grandparent that I had much contact with, since the
others lived overseas and had passed away while I was young.
Nanna was also always the central figure at family gatherings.
This made her passing all the more difficult.
