<p>Status: <a href="../status/">started</a>.</p>
<p>My grandmother passed away on 2014-11-17, at the age of 94.</p>
<p>When <a href="../Mum/">Mum</a> told me that Nanna had died, it was a very surreal
feeling.
The only thought I had, that blocked all others, was to get
<a href="../Doug/" title="my younger brother">Doug</a> and travel to see Mum at the
nursing home.</p>
<p>Nanna was the only grandparent that I had much contact with, since the
others lived overseas and had passed away while I was young.
Nanna was also always the central figure at family gatherings.
This made her passing all the more difficult.</p>
