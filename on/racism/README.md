# Racism

I enjoy the TV show [The Boondocks][1] and laugh at the over-the-top
racism of [Uncle Ruckus][2].
Despite the absurdity of what he gets away with, it is disappointing
that some people may hold those views.

Watching the following TED talk showed determination and a level of
restraint that seems more than most would be capable of.

By avoiding being racist directly to his face, it seems to show that
they were aware they were doing the wrong thing.
