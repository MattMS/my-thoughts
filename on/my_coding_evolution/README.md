# My coding evolution

This page describes my journey learning various programming languages.

My Dad told me I wrote my first program when I was 5 years old.
Probably printing something like
["Hello World"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program).
I am not surprised, given my memories of computers as a child, but I
cannot say I remember it.


## BASIC

The first device I remember writing code on was a
[TRS-80 Color Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer)
that was plugged into our TV.

Someone had given it to my Dad for me to play with, along with a
cassette recorder to save and load programs and a book teaching
[BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

I remember going through the book and writing up programs using the
command line input that required you to start each line with a number.
You had to enter a command to list the code and reuse a number to
replace a line.
It was encouraged to use steps of 10, in case you needed to insert a
line later.

At the end of the book was a certificate stating
"You are now a computer programmer!"


## QuickBASIC

The first major jump for me was getting a computer running
[MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS),
which included a copy of
[QuickBASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC).

Finally an editor where I could read and edit my code at the same time!

I continued to label each line with a number, and used
[GOTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto)
statements for control flow.

I started writing graphical games, as opposed to ASCII art, in glorious
640 x 480, 16 colour resolution!

I only recall finishing 1 game during this time: a side-scrolling
shooter with multiple weapons and aliens in space ships.
[One of my friends](https://twitter.com/gpburdon)
enjoyed it for a bit at least.


## HTML

My first experiences with
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
were creating very basic websites, using frames and font tags.

I still stuck to BASIC because I could use it to make games.


## Java

On reaching year 12, I got to attend my first programming class,
learning [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29).

I continued to write all my code in
[Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29),
but later discovered the
[Eclipse editor](https://eclipse.org/).

During the year, I made a version of
[Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29)
as a side project.

My end of year project was a game of
[Battleships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29)
that put the player against an AI player.
The AI would shoot randomly until finding a boat, then it would fire
around the boat to find the direction, then fire in a line until it was
sunk.

All code was written as
[Java applets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet),
that were embedded in HTML pages.


## C/C++

During [University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania),
I learned to create command line programs using C.

I did a 3D modelling course during my final year that involved creating
an animation with C and OpenGL.

My marker commended me as one of the few students to use
[destructors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructor_%28computer_programming%29).


## PHP

Another University course involved learning PHP.
The recommended approach at the time was to use tables for layout.

PHP was the only server-side language I used until I started work at the
Australian Antarctic Division.


## Python

My first job out of University required me to learn
[Python](https://www.python.org/).

This was the second most significant point in my learning, because it
introduced me to a language that spans many disciplines and has a
passionate community.

During this time I got to see the release of Python 3 and then view the
very slow conversion rate.
It was only after the release of Python 3.4 that I switched over for all
my code.


## ColdFusion

Starting at the Australian Antarctic Division required me to learn
[ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language)
and [Oracle databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database).

I will hold back on further comments here, apart from saying I think the
[Railo](http://www.getrailo.org/) team are doing some nice
work, at least if you need to use ColdFusion.


## Node.js

I started playing with [Node.js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
around 2012, initially with [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
But the lack of Oracle drivers at the time made it impossible to use for
AAD work.

I continued to play with Node.js using
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
and [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
for personal projects.


## Django

After [PyCon Australia 2013](http://2013.pycon-au.org/), I started
learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and decided that it
was the way forward for the Data Centre.

It allowed me to use my Python skills, that I had been maintaining on
side projects, and use an
[ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that worked with Oracle and avoided increasingly complex
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) statements.

This all seemed great during 2013 and the start of 2014.


## Static HTML and APIs

Trying to find a host for my personal website ended with me using
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
This required I create a static website, with no server side code.

Initially this was a pain, but I slowly learned the advantages of
compiling HTML code and using Javascript to access APIs.


## And now

I have returned to the Node.js/io.js ecosystem, using NPM and the Unix
philosophy of chaining modular, single-purpose tools.

I am still learning [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/),
[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) and
[Elasticseach](https://www.elasticsearch.org/).
The more I learn of these, the more I am excited about this approach.

Using CoffeeScript, Jade and Stylus, along with Markdown, is keeping me
happy.

I am also keeping an eye on
[web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
as a possible extension of my use of Jade mixins.
