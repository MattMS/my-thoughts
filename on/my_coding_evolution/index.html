<p>This page describes my journey learning various programming languages.</p>
<p>My Dad told me I wrote my first program when I was 5 years old.
Probably printing something like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program">&quot;Hello World&quot;</a>.
I am not surprised, given my memories of computers as a child, but I
cannot say I remember it.</p>
<h2 id="basic">BASIC</h2>
<p>The first device I remember writing code on was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">TRS-80 Color Computer</a>
that was plugged into our TV.</p>
<p>Someone had given it to my Dad for me to play with, along with a
cassette recorder to save and load programs and a book teaching
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>I remember going through the book and writing up programs using the
command line input that required you to start each line with a number.
You had to enter a command to list the code and reuse a number to
replace a line.
It was encouraged to use steps of 10, in case you needed to insert a
line later.</p>
<p>At the end of the book was a certificate stating
&quot;You are now a computer programmer!&quot;</p>
<h2 id="quickbasic">QuickBASIC</h2>
<p>The first major jump for me was getting a computer running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>,
which included a copy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Finally an editor where I could read and edit my code at the same time!</p>
<p>I continued to label each line with a number, and used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">GOTO</a>
statements for control flow.</p>
<p>I started writing graphical games, as opposed to ASCII art, in glorious
640 x 480, 16 colour resolution!</p>
<p>I only recall finishing 1 game during this time: a side-scrolling
shooter with multiple weapons and aliens in space ships.
<a href="https://twitter.com/gpburdon">One of my friends</a>
enjoyed it for a bit at least.</p>
<h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>My first experiences with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
were creating very basic websites, using frames and font tags.</p>
<p>I still stuck to BASIC because I could use it to make games.</p>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p>On reaching year 12, I got to attend my first programming class,
learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>.</p>
<p>I continued to write all my code in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29">Notepad</a>,
but later discovered the
<a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse editor</a>.</p>
<p>During the year, I made a version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29">Snake</a>
as a side project.</p>
<p>My end of year project was a game of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29">Battleships</a>
that put the player against an AI player.
The AI would shoot randomly until finding a boat, then it would fire
around the boat to find the direction, then fire in a line until it was
sunk.</p>
<p>All code was written as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a>,
that were embedded in HTML pages.</p>
<h2 id="c-c-">C/C++</h2>
<p>During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania">University</a>,
I learned to create command line programs using C.</p>
<p>I did a 3D modelling course during my final year that involved creating
an animation with C and OpenGL.</p>
<p>My marker commended me as one of the few students to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructor_%28computer_programming%29">destructors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="php">PHP</h2>
<p>Another University course involved learning PHP.
The recommended approach at the time was to use tables for layout.</p>
<p>PHP was the only server-side language I used until I started work at the
Australian Antarctic Division.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>My first job out of University required me to learn
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
<p>This was the second most significant point in my learning, because it
introduced me to a language that spans many disciplines and has a
passionate community.</p>
<p>During this time I got to see the release of Python 3 and then view the
very slow conversion rate.
It was only after the release of Python 3.4 that I switched over for all
my code.</p>
<h2 id="coldfusion">ColdFusion</h2>
<p>Starting at the Australian Antarctic Division required me to learn
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language">ColdFusion</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle databases</a>.</p>
<p>I will hold back on further comments here, apart from saying I think the
<a href="http://www.getrailo.org/">Railo</a> team are doing some nice
work, at least if you need to use ColdFusion.</p>
<h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2>
<p>I started playing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js</a>
around 2012, initially with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>.
But the lack of Oracle drivers at the time made it impossible to use for
AAD work.</p>
<p>I continued to play with Node.js using
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>,
<a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>
and <a href="https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a>
for personal projects.</p>
<h2 id="django">Django</h2>
<p>After <a href="http://2013.pycon-au.org/">PyCon Australia 2013</a>, I started
learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and decided that it
was the way forward for the Data Centre.</p>
<p>It allowed me to use my Python skills, that I had been maintaining on
side projects, and use an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>
that worked with Oracle and avoided increasingly complex
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> statements.</p>
<p>This all seemed great during 2013 and the start of 2014.</p>
<h2 id="static-html-and-apis">Static HTML and APIs</h2>
<p>Trying to find a host for my personal website ended with me using
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.
This required I create a static website, with no server side code.</p>
<p>Initially this was a pain, but I slowly learned the advantages of
compiling HTML code and using Javascript to access APIs.</p>
<h2 id="and-now">And now</h2>
<p>I have returned to the Node.js/io.js ecosystem, using NPM and the Unix
philosophy of chaining modular, single-purpose tools.</p>
<p>I am still learning <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>,
<a href="http://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> and
<a href="https://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticseach</a>.
The more I learn of these, the more I am excited about this approach.</p>
<p>Using CoffeeScript, Jade and Stylus, along with Markdown, is keeping me
happy.</p>
<p>I am also keeping an eye on
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">web components</a>
as a possible extension of my use of Jade mixins.</p>
