# Swapped shopping game

Whenever I am shopping and I spot an item that is obviously in the
wrong place, I like to imagine the thoughts of the person that placed
it there.


## Memorable swaps

### Beans to Pop-Tarts

> These refried beans sure are delicious, but maybe these
> [Pop-Tarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts)
> would make a nicer snack.


### Water to Coke

Spotted water in the [Coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola)
section near the checkout and thought about someone that had carried the
water around the whole store and almost made it out but then fell to the
temptation just before leaving.
