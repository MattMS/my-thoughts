# Swapped shopping game

Status: [started](../status/).

Whenever I am shopping and I spot an item that is obviously in the
wrong place, I like to imagine the thoughts of the person that placed
it there.


## Memorable swaps

### Beans to Pop-Tarts

Alternatively, they could have a great recipe for Pop-Tart burritos.


### Water to Coke

Noticed a bottle of water surrounded by
[Coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola)
near the checkout and thought about someone that had carried the water
around the entire store but then fell to the temptation just before
leaving.
