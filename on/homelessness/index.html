<p>Status: <a href="../status/">started</a>.</p>
<p>This is meant to highlight my incorrect conclusions from a logical
process based on a lack of research on the subject.</p>
<p>I am hoping to find information to correct my thought processes and
ideally educate others that may have followed the same thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="my-original-misconceptions">My original misconceptions</h2>
<p>Growing up in Australia and receiving money while studying and
job-hunting provided by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrelink">Centrelink</a>,
it has been difficult for me to understand why there is still
homelessness.</p>
<p>If the government provides assistance, then the only reason people would
be homeless would be by choice.
But why would someone choose to be homeless?</p>
<p>Possibly they are unable to make logical decisions due to a mental
disability.
But there are services for people with disabilities that should prevent
this too.</p>
<p>Looking at groups that provide assistance to the homeless, such as food
and temporary shelter, it seems like they were only treating the
symptoms and not focusing on the cause: lack of permanent shelter.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-thoughts">My current thoughts</h2>
<p>I am aware those thoughts do not take into account all the factors that
the better educated will be aware of.
So now I will aim to learn more and provide corrections to them.</p>
<p>I can at least put one thought forward that I feel is correct:</p>
<p>If you have the ability, please donate to organisations that help the
disadvantaged.
Even if for no other reason than the hope that such organisations will
be available should you ever need them.</p>
