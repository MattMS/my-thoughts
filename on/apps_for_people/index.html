<p>This describes how to focus your development on the people you are
working for, rather than simply building what they think they want.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-what">Why not what</h2>
<p>You should think about who needs infromation from the application and
how they are wanting to use it.</p>
<p>There will likely be more types of users than you initially expect.</p>
<h3 id="users-in-a-messaging-app">Users in a messaging app</h3>
<p>Here are some of the possible user types for a messaging platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All users want to send and receive messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users want to be able to organise and view old messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Group managers want to add and remove users from their group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Account managers want to create new accounts and reset passwords.</p>
</li>
<li><p>System managers want to know the usage and growth rate of storage so
they can know when they need to increase the capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning user types will expose the scope of the project and allow
planning of new user interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="regular-feedback">Regular feedback</h2>
<p>You should try to have something to test at regular intervals, such as
every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>When people test what you are making, they will give feedback that may
change the initial scope and direction of the project.</p>
<p>This is not a bad thing, as long as the client is made aware of the
consequences of the choices they are requesting.</p>
