# Apps for people

This describes how to focus your development on the people you are
working for, rather than simply building what they think they want.


## Why not what

You should think about who needs infromation from the application and
how they are wanting to use it.

There will likely be more types of users than you initially expect.


### Users in a messaging app

Here are some of the possible user types for a messaging platform.

- All users want to send and receive messages.

- Users want to be able to organise and view old messages.

- Group managers want to add and remove users from their group.

- Account managers want to create new accounts and reset passwords.

- System managers want to know the usage and growth rate of storage so
  they can know when they need to increase the capacity.

Learning user types will expose the scope of the project and allow
planning of new user interfaces.


## Regular feedback

You should try to have something to test at regular intervals, such as
every 2 weeks.

When people test what you are making, they will give feedback that may
change the initial scope and direction of the project.

This is not a bad thing, as long as the client is made aware of the
consequences of the choices they are requesting.
