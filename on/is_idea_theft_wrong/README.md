# Is idea theft wrong?

When working in a creative industry or one that involves community
events, it is likely you will be presented with ideas that you find
interesting but are not in control of implementing.

This page details some scenarios that may arise from those situations
and discusses their morality.


## Scenarios

These scenarios do not consider profit or other gains made by
implementing the idea.
Gains would likely be determined by other market forces.

You should assume the participants cannot work together for whatever
reason.
If they could work together then this article does not apply.


### Copy idea first

> Albert has an idea and tells Anna about it.
> Anna implements the idea before Albert does.


### Copy idea after

> Beth has an idea and tells Bob about it.
> Beth implements the idea and Bob implements it after.


### Copy and enhance idea after

> Charlie has an idea and tells Chloe about it.
> Charlie implements his idea.
> Chloe thinks of an enhancement and implements both.


## Outcomes

### Waiting politely

If Albert is unable to implement the idea, then the world misses out on
having it.

How long should Anna wait before deciding she should do it?
